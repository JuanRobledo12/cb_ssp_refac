## Getting Started

### Prerequisites (TODO)
- Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies.
- Install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `new_ver_test.ipynb`.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to run the configuration and analysis.

### Configuration
The default configuration is set to:

```yaml
src/config_files/tornado_iran.yaml
```

This file contains the parameters and settings for the specific transformation strategies. If you wish to use a different configuration, update the `yaml_config` parameter in the notebook to point to your desired YAML file.
